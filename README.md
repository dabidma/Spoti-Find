## **Project Description:**
We constructed a song recommendation system to help induividuals add songs to favorite playlists. Using spotify API and user-friendly Spotipy, machine learning models were created to be the back bone to the recommendation system; a continuously learning model which gets better time. 

## Project Outline
1. Set up developer account to **access Spotify API credentials**; making API calls to retrieve necessary data

   [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.0)  
   [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/)

2. Take into consideration the **data most useful** for our purposes
3. Make the data API calls to **retrieve your data**
4. **Clean Data** and remove unnecessary information
5. **Split the data** into training and test sets. You'll use the training set to train your model, and the test set to evaluate its performance.
6. **Extract features from the data**. Making sure the ML models can use the features
7. **Train a machine learning model**. We choose an appropriate model for your data and goals, such as a collaborative filtering model or a content-based recommendation system. You'll then need to train the model using the training data
8. **Evaluate the model's performance**. Use the test data to evaluate the model's performance in terms of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. You may need to adjust the model's hyperparameters or try a different model if the performance is not satisfactory.
9. **Use the model to make recommendations**. Once you have a trained model, you can use it to make recommendations to users based on their input.
